## Peak Finding

```
One - dimensional version
    [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i]     a-i are numbers not indexes
     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

    Position 2 is a peak, if and only if b >= a and b >= c  (look left and right)
    Edges: Position 9 is a peak if i >= h (only look right)


1. Problem(one dimensional): Find a peak (if it exists)
